I’m into building smart stuff with AI, writing clean backend code, and making things actually work.  

---

### 🛠️ What I’m working on:
- Plugging **Llama.cpp**, **LangChain**, and **FastAPI** into real-world apps  
- Automating boring things so they stay boring (and outta my way)  
- Spinning up scalable systems with **Docker**, **CI/CD**, and **PostgreSQL**  
- Making platform bots that *actually* do things people want

---

### 📚 Always learning more about:
Machine learning, AI dev, system design, and keeping my code from turning into spaghetti 🍝

---

### 🧠 Skills I vibe with:
`FastAPI`, `Python`, `Docker`, `LangChain`, `Flutter`, `Discord.py`, `PostgreSQL`, `API Dev`, `Llama.cpp`, `Automation`, `CI/CD`, `ML and Deep learning`, and more.

---

### 🤝 Down to collab on:
Cool AI projects, smart automation tools, backend systems that scale, or even something experimental.

### ⚡ Random facts because why not:
- 🎧 I mess with music production  
- 🎬 I edit better than I film  
- 🧄 Somehow always burn garlic in 2 seconds  
- 🐛 I find bugs just by breathing near the code
